# 3d-wavefront-.obj-screensaver-with-transparancy-sfml-opengl

changes: added ffmpeg.exe desktop grab to use as background image for smoother transparent pixels at edge of 3d object.
(With transparent background also non-full transparent pixels are drawn 100% opaque (non transparent)). 
ffmpeg.exe included.

changes: pong lightning by fragment shader instead of vertex shader.


3d wavefront .obj loader as screensaver. uses sfml / windows for creating window with tranasparancy to draw sfml / opengl upon
